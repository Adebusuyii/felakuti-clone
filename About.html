               <p>Fela Anikulapo Kuti was a Nigerian multi-instrumentalist, musician, songwriter, Afrobeat music pioneer, and human rights campaigner. 
                 At the height of his fame, he was described as one of Africa's most "difficult and compelling music artists." Funmilayo, his 
                 mother, was a feminist activist and anti-colonialist who was the first woman in Nigeria to drive an automobile. His father,
                 Israel Oludotun, was an Anglican preacher and the founder of the 'Nigeria Union of Teachers.' He had two brothers, 
                 Beko and Olikoye, both of whom went on to become well-known doctors, as well as a sister, Dolu. 
                 Wole Soyinka, his cousin, was a writer who was the first African to win the 'Nobel Prize for Literature.'
                 After graduating from high school in Abeokuta, Kuti worked as a clerk at the 'Federal Ministry of Commerce' for a short time before being moved to London to study medicine. 
                 After arriving in London, he decided to study music at the 'Trinity College of Music.' 
                 Polygamy was a practise practised by Fela Kuti. The first of Kuti's spouses was a lady named Remi. In a single wedding ceremony in 1978, Kuti wedded 27 more ladies. 
                 He'd divorce them all eventually. Kuti had a son, Femi, and two daughters, Yeni and Sola, with Remi. Sola passed away from cancer not long after her father died in 1997. 
                 The Positive Force, a band they created in the 1980s, with all three of their children as members. Fela Kuti was one of the world's most avant-garde musicians. 
                 His politically charged songs, cutting album names and covers, and unapologetic denunciation of the Nigerian government (which resulted in the notorious raid on his compound, 
                 resulting in the murder of his mother and placing him in jail) are all clear indications of this.Kuti's musical style is called Afrobeat. It is a style he largely created, and 
                 is a complex fusion of jazz, funk, highlife, and traditional Nigerian, African chants and rhythms. It contains elements of psychedelic soul and has similarities to James Brown's style of composition. 
                 Afrobeat also borrows heavily from the native "tinker pan".[35] Tony Allen (Kuti's drummer of twenty years) was instrumental in the creation of Afrobeat. Kuti once stated that "there would be no Afrobeat without Tony Allen".
                 Fela Kuti's band was notable for featuring two baritone saxophones when most groups only used one. This is a common technique in African and African-influenced musical styles and can be seen in funk and hip hop. His bands 
                 sometimes performed with two bassists at the same time both playing interlocking melodies and rhythms. There were always two or more guitarists. The electric West African style guitar in Afrobeat bands is paramount but is
                 used to give basic structure, playing a repeating chordal/melodic statement, riff, or groove.

               <p>On 3 August 1997, Kuti's brother Olikoye Ransome-Kuti, already a prominent AIDS activist and former Minister of Health, announced that Kuti had died on the previous day from complications related to AIDS. Kuti had been an
                  AIDS denialist,[31] and his widow maintained that he did not die of AIDS.[32][33] His youngest son Seun took the role of leading Kuti's former band Egypt 80. As of 2020, the band is still active, releasing music under the moniker Seun Kuti & Egypt 80.
